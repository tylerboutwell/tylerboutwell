## üëã Hi there, I'm Tyler

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for software engineering and web development. I learned about coding and started building beginner apps.

Since then, I've been continuously learning and building. I enjoy diving into how different technologies work together, and I‚Äôm always exploring new tech stacks. My favorite projects involve building fully responsive, full-stack web applications that solve real problems and look great on any device.

I'm always excited to learn more, collaborate on cool projects, and grow as a developer!
